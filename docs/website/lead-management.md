**Heading:** Lead Management & Capture
**Subheading:** Turn PDF downloads into qualified sales leads (Pro & Agency)

---

## Section 2: Overview

### What is Lead Capture?

Lead Capture is a **Pro feature** that collects contact information from visitors before they download PDF submittal packets. Instead of anonymous downloads, you'll know exactly who's interested in your products.

**How it works:**
1. Customer selects products on your builder page
2. Clicks "Generate PDF"
3. **Modal appears** asking for email and phone
4. Customer enters info and submits
5. PDF is generated and downloaded
6. **You receive email notification** with lead details
7. Lead is saved to your database for follow-up

**Perfect for:**
- Distributors who want to know who's browsing their catalog
- Sales teams who need qualified leads
- Businesses tracking marketing ROI
- Anyone who wants to follow up with potential customers

## Section 5: Lead Routing (Agency Feature)

### What is Lead Routing?

**Agency feature** that automatically routes leads to the right sales rep or system based on configurable rules.

- Route leads from `@contractor.com` to commercial team
- Route leads with UTM source "google-ads" to marketing team
- Route leads selecting "HVAC" category to HVAC specialist
- Send all leads to Zapier webhook for CRM integration

---

### How Lead Routing Works

**Path:** `Submittal Builder ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Lead Routing`

**1. Create Rules**

Each rule has:
- **Name** (e.g., "Commercial Contractors")
- **Conditions** (when to match):
  - Email domain (e.g., `contractor.com, builder.com`)
  - UTM source (e.g., `google, facebook`)
  - UTM medium (e.g., `cpc, social`)
  - UTM campaign (e.g., `spring-promo`)
  - Top category (e.g., "Steel Studs")
- **Actions** (what to do):
  - Send email to: `sales-team@company.com`
  - Send webhook to: `https://hooks.zapier.com/...`

**2. Set Priority**

Rules are evaluated **top to bottom**. First match wins.

Drag to reorder rules by priority.

**3. Set Fallback**

If no rules match, lead goes to fallback:
- Fallback email (optional)
- Fallback webhook (optional)

---

### Creating Your First Routing Rule

**Example: Route contractor emails to commercial team**

1. Go to `Settings ‚Üí Lead Routing`
2. Click **"+ Add Rule"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name:** "Commercial Contractors"
   - **Email Domains:** `contractor.com, builder.com, construction.com`
   - **Then Email:** `commercial-sales@mycompany.com`
   - **Enabled:** ‚úÖ ON
4. Click **"Save Rule"**

**Result:**
Any lead from `john@contractor.com` will route to `commercial-sales@mycompany.com`

---

## Section 9: Troubleshooting

### Modal Not Appearing

**Problem:** Lead capture modal doesn't show before PDF download.

**Solutions:**

2. Clear browser cache and refresh page
3. Check for JavaScript errors in browser console (F12)
4. Disable conflicting plugins temporarily
5. Test with default WordPress theme

---

### Email Notifications Not Sending

**Problem:** No email alert when lead is captured.

**Solutions:**
1. Check `Settings ‚Üí Lead Capture ‚Üí Notification Email` is correct
2. Test email delivery: `Settings ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Test Email`
3. Check spam/junk folder
4. Verify WordPress can send email (try WP Mail SMTP plugin)
5. Check server email logs for errors

---

### Webhooks Failing

**Problem:** Webhook not receiving lead data.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify webhook URL uses HTTPS (HTTP not allowed)
2. Check webhook endpoint is accessible (not behind firewall)
3. View delivery log: `Settings ‚Üí Lead Routing ‚Üí Delivery Log`
4. Test webhook with RequestBin or webhook.site
5. Check webhook endpoint accepts POST requests with JSON

**Webhook retry:**
Plugin retries failed webhooks 4 times with exponential backoff (30s, 2m, 10m).

---

### Leads Not Saving

**Problem:** Form submits but lead doesn't appear in database.

**Solutions:**
1. Check database table exists: `wp_sfb_leads`
2. Check PHP error logs for database errors
3. Verify database user has INSERT permissions
4. Check rate limiting (max 5 per hour per email/IP)
5. Test with different email address

---

### CSV Export Empty

**Problem:** CSV export downloads but has no data.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify leads exist in `Leads` page
2. Check date range filter (if any)
3. Try exporting single lead first
4. Check browser download folder
5. Verify you have `manage_options` capability (admin)

---

## Section 10: Best Practices

### For Maximum Lead Conversion

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Keep form simple (email + phone only)
- Use clear value proposition: "Get your PDF"
- Make phone field optional (reduces friction)
- Add consent checkbox for GDPR compliance
- Test modal on mobile devices
- Send follow-up email within 24 hours

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Ask for too many fields (reduces conversions)
- Make phone required (not everyone has it handy)
- Hide privacy notice
- Send generic follow-ups (personalize based on products selected)

---

### For Lead Routing Rules

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Order rules by specificity (most specific first)
- Use email domain matching for B2B leads
- Use UTM matching for campaign-specific routing
- Test rules before enabling
- Set up fallback routing
- Monitor delivery log regularly

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Create overlapping rules (first match wins)
- Route to invalid email addresses
- Use HTTP webhooks (HTTPS only)
- Forget to enable rules after testing
- Ignore delivery failures

---

### For Follow-Up

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Reply within 24 hours (leads go cold fast)
- Reference specific products they selected
- Mention project name in subject line
- Provide value (answer questions, offer help)
- Track leads in your CRM

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Send generic "Thanks for your interest" emails
- Ignore UTM data (tells you how they found you)
- Wait more than 48 hours to follow up
- Spam them with sales pitches
- Forget to personalize based on their selection

## FAQs

**Q: Can I customize the lead capture form fields?**

A: Not via settings, but you can use filters to customize:
- Field labels
- Privacy text
- Consent checkbox text
- Required fields

See [Developer Documentation](/documentation/developer/#lead-capture-filters)

---

**Q: Can I turn off lead capture for specific pages?**

A: Yes, use this filter in your theme's `functions.php`:

```php
add_filter('sfb_lead_capture_enabled', function($enabled) {
  if (is_page('demo')) {
    return false; // Disable on demo page
  }
  return $enabled;
});
```

---

**Q: Are leads stored forever?**

A: Yes, until you manually delete them. You can:
- Delete individual leads from Leads page
- Bulk delete old leads from Settings ‚Üí Database
- Export to CSV and delete from WordPress

Recommended: Export monthly and delete leads older than 12 months.

---

**Q: Can I import leads from another system?**

A: Not via UI, but you can import via database or WP-CLI. Contact support for assistance.

---

**Q: What happens if someone enters a fake email?**

A: The form validates email format (must be valid email address), but cannot verify if email exists.

**Best practice:** Send follow-up email immediately. Bounced emails indicate fake addresses.

---

**Q: Can I integrate with my CRM automatically?**

A: Yes, use webhooks (Agency feature) to send leads to:
- Zapier (connects to 5000+ apps)
- Make/Integromat
- Your custom CRM API

See [Webhook Integration](#webhook-integration)

---

**Q: Do I get charged per lead?**

A: No. Unlimited leads included with Pro/Agency license.

---

**Q: Can I add custom fields to the lead capture form?**

A: Custom fields require code customization. Use filters:

```php
add_filter('sfb_lead_capture_fields', function($fields) {
  $fields['company'] = [
    'type' => 'text',
    'label' => 'Company Name',
    'required' => false,
  ];
  return $fields;
});
```
