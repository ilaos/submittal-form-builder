## Overview

Submittal & Spec Sheet Builder was originally designed for construction submittal packets, but it solves a broader problem affecting any B2B business with complex product catalogs.

### Two Core Problems We Solve

**Problem 1: Time-Consuming Documentation**

Many businesses spend excessive time creating product documentation:
- Sales teams manually creating spec sheets (2-3 hours each)
- Contractors building submittal packets for every project
- Engineers compiling product data for permits and approvals
- Distributors answering "what products do you have?" calls repeatedly

**Problem 2: Large Catalogs That Don't Fit on Websites**

Businesses with extensive inventories face unique challenges:
- 500-10,000+ SKUs that can't all be listed on product pages
- Complex hierarchies (categories → products → types → models)
- Technical specifications needed for project planning
- No self-service option for customers to browse and select

### Our Solution

Turn your product catalog into an interactive builder where customers:
1. Browse your full inventory
2. Select exactly what they need
3. Generate professional PDF spec sheets
4. You capture their contact info before download

## Primary Market: Construction & Building

### What is a Submittal Packet?

Construction professionals need to create **submittal packets** for general contractors, architects, and building inspectors. A submittal packet is a collection of product specification sheets required for:

- Building permits
- Code compliance
- Architect approval
- Project documentation

**Time saved:** From 2-3 hours per submittal to 5 minutes with automation.
