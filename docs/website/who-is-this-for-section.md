## Alternative: If You Want Shorter Copy (Condensed Option 1)

generate professional PDFs forever.

## Design Tips

1. **Use real photos** instead of emoji if possible (stock photos of construction sites, warehouses, industrial equipment)
2. **Add subtle hover effects** on cards to make them interactive
3. **Keep it above the fold** or just below the hero section
4. **Use your brand colors** for the checkmarks and CTAs
5. **Add testimonials** below this section to reinforce credibility

---

## Copy Variations for Testing

### More Casual Tone:
**Headline:** "Is This Plugin Right For You?"
**Subhead:** "If any of these sound like you, the answer is yes."

### More Professional Tone:
**Headline:** "Purpose-Built for Three Critical Industries"
**Subhead:** "Construction documentation, complex catalogs, and equipment specifications."

### More Benefit-Focused:
**Headline:** "Save 20+ Hours Per Week on Documentation"
**Subhead:** "Whether you're creating submittals or managing catalogs, automation is the answer."
