# Dropdown Field Type Feature - Testing Guide

**Feature:** Product Configurator with Dropdown Field Types
**Status:** Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing
**Date:** 2025-10-21

---

## What Was Implemented

### Backend (Admin Interface)
- **Field Types Tab** on Type and Subtype nodes
- Toggle fields between "Text Input" and "Dropdown"
- Add/remove dropdown options
- Auto-save on every change
- Field inheritance: Models inherit from parent Type/Subtype

### Frontend (Product Selection)
- Dropdown selectors appear on product cards for select-type fields
- Users can choose values from dropdowns
- Selected values stored separately from database defaults
- Auto-selects product when dropdown value is chosen

### PDF Generation
- User-selected dropdown values override database specs
- PDFs show the values the user actually selected
- Works with both review and legacy product submission formats

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Part 1: Configure Field Types (Admin)

1. **Go to:** Submittal Builder â†’ Catalog Builder
2. **Find a Type or Subtype** (e.g., "20 Gauge 30 MIL")
3. **Click on it** to open Inspector modal
4. **Click "Field Types" tab**
5. **Find a field** (e.g., "KSI")
6. **Toggle to "Dropdown"** - Should see "âœ“ Saving..." then "âœ“ Saved"
7. **Add options:** 33, 50
8. **Close modal and reopen** - Verify it stayed as Dropdown with options

**Expected Result:** Field type persists as Dropdown with options intact

---

### âœ… Part 2: Toggle Back to Text (Admin)

1. **Open same Type's Field Types tab**
2. **Find the dropdown field** (e.g., "KSI")
3. **Toggle back to "Text Input"** - Should see "âœ“ Saving..." then "âœ“ Saved"
4. **Close modal and reopen** - Verify it's now Text Input (options should be gone)

**Expected Result:** Field type persists as Text Input

**This was the bug we just fixed!** Previously it would revert back to Dropdown.

---

### âœ… Part 3: Verify Frontend Dropdowns

1. **Go to:** Your frontend builder page (with `[submittal_builder]` shortcode)
2. **Find a product** that inherits from the Type you configured
3. **Look for dropdown** on the product card

**Expected Result:**
- If field is configured as Dropdown â†’ Shows dropdown with options
- If field is configured as Text â†’ Shows normal spec text (no dropdown)

---

### âœ… Part 4: Select Dropdown Values

1. **Find a product card** with a dropdown (e.g., KSI dropdown)
2. **Select a value** from dropdown (e.g., "50")
3. **Check browser console** - Should log: `[SFB] Field "KSI" set to "50" for product...`
4. **Verify product auto-selected** - Should appear in "Selected Products" tray

**Expected Result:** Dropdown value is captured and product is auto-selected

---

### âœ… Part 5: Generate PDF with Selected Values

1. **Select 2-3 products** with dropdown fields
2. **Choose different values** for each (e.g., Product A: KSI=33, Product B: KSI=50)
3. **Click "Continue" or "VIEW â†’"** to go to Review step
4. **Add project name** (optional)
5. **Click "Generate PDF"**
6. **Open the PDF**
7. **Check spec sheets** for each product

**Expected Result:**
- Product A spec sheet shows KSI = 33 (the value you selected)
- Product B spec sheet shows KSI = 50 (the value you selected)
- NOT the database default values

## Key Implementation Details

### Admin (assets/admin.js)

**Lines 1354-1415:** Inline save on field type toggle
- Builds payload with fresh `newConfigs` directly
- Doesn't rely on React state update
- Fixes closure issue where `autoSave()` captured stale state

**Lines 1021-1045:** Field inheritance logic
- Models check parent Type/Subtype for `field_configs`
- Walks up parent chain if needed
- Falls back to text input if no configs found

### Frontend (assets/js/frontend.js)

**Lines 434-473:** `buildConfigurableFields()` function
- Filters for select-type fields
- Renders HTML dropdowns with options
- Pre-selects current value if exists

**Lines 727-749:** Dropdown change handlers
- Stores selected values in `state.selectedFieldValues` Map
- Keyed by `composite_key`
- Auto-selects product on value change

**Lines 1163-1180:** PDF submission
- Converts Map to plain object
- Sends as `selected_field_values` POST parameter
- Works with both review and legacy formats

### Backend (submittal-form-builder.php)

**Lines 6307-6324:** Field configs API
- Inherits from parent Type/Subtype
- Returns `field_configs` array in products API

**Lines 6435-6467:** Receive selected values
- Decodes `selected_field_values` JSON
- Builds `composite_key â†’ product_id` map

**Lines 6520-6530:** Merge into specs
- Looks up product by composite_key
- Merges user-selected values over database specs
- Logs merge for debugging

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Field type doesn't persist when toggling
**Solution:** This was the closure bug - now fixed with inline save approach

### Issue: Dropdown doesn't show on frontend
**Possible Causes:**
- Field not configured as "Dropdown" on parent Type/Subtype
- No options added to dropdown
- Browser cache - try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: PDF shows database value, not selected value
**Possible Causes:**
- Check browser console for `[SFB]` logs during PDF generation
- Verify `selected_field_values` is being sent in POST
- Check PHP error logs for merge confirmation

---

## Debug Logging

### Frontend Console
Look for these log messages:
```
[SFB] Field "KSI" set to "50" for product category::product_label
```

### PHP Error Logs
Look for these log messages:
```
[SFB] Merged user-selected values for product 123: Array([KSI] => 50)
```

## Next Steps After Testing

If everything works:
1. âœ… Test with multiple field types (Size, Thickness, etc.)
2. âœ… Test with Subtypes (should inherit from grandparent Type)
3. âœ… Test toggling between Text â†” Dropdown multiple times
4. âœ… Generate PDFs with various dropdown combinations
5. âœ… Test on mobile devices

If you find issues:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Check WordPress debug log for PHP errors
- Provide specific steps to reproduce the issue

**Implementation Complete!** ðŸŽ‰

All code changes have been made and the inline save fix has been applied to resolve the field type persistence issue.
