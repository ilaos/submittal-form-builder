BACKUP FILES - DO NOT ACTIVATE

This directory contains backup copies of plugin files created before major changes.

Files have been renamed with .txt extensions to prevent WordPress from
detecting them as active plugins.

To restore a backup:
1. Deactivate the main plugin
2. Rename the backup file to remove .txt extension
3. Copy to parent directory
4. Activate
